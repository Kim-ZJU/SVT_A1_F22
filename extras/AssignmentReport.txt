Focus your report on assignment goals

1. Why were test doubles necessary in this assignment? 

Since neither DAO and the data store exists, but we still want to test the functionality of the SocialNetwork API,
test doubles are necessary and helpful in tackling our tasks. Both AccountDAOFake and mock(IAccountDAO.class) help
to break the coupling between the real implementation class "AccountDAO" and the class "SocialNetwork", enabling
us to test the functionality without affecting the real data store.

2. What were the advantages and disadvantages of the different kinds of test doubles
you used? What differences did you observe in their behavior and their ability to reveal faults?

- The AccountDAOFake used an in-memory database that stands in for real database, which was constructed without help
from mocking frameworks. So, in real test workspace, we don't need to add mock into libraries. However, the DAOFake
could be difficult to create and burdensome to maintain if the real DAO had more new functionalities.

-Using spy did not need us to implement a (fake) DAO, which saved us a lot of time. However, a spy could only verify 
how many times an invocation being called, which was very limited.

3. List the faults found in the production or test code.

// use a bullet list, be specific, referring to broken tests and associated methods

- test canLeaveSocialNetwork() failed because the leave() method in SN.java did not use accountDAO.delete() method
- test recommendMembersReturnsSharedFriendsOfMyFriends() failed because the recommendFriends() method in SN.java did not exclude the loggedIn user itself and its friends
- tests willAttemptToPersistSendingAFriendRequest(), willAttemptToPersistAcceptanceOfFriendRequest(), 
  and willAttemptToPersistRejectionOfFriendRequest() failed because sendFriendshipTo, acceptFriendshipFrom,
  and rejectFriendshipFrom need to update both the sending and receiving users
- test sendFriendshipCancellationTo() failed because cancelFriendship need to update 
  the OutgoingRequests and IncomingRequests of the user
